# Kubernetes Exercises

This collection covers a set of exercises that are categorized topics wise and referred back to the individual Kubernetes certification exams.
As the exam pattern and topics keep on changing, however, the topics remain more or less the same, I have created the exercises per topics and mapped them back to the exam.

## Kubernetes Playground

Try out the Killercoda Kubernetes playgroud which provides 2 node Kubernetes cluster, which is good enough to complete almost all of the exercises.

## Exam Pattern & Tips

 - CKA/CKAD/CKS are open book test.
 - Exams keep on upgrading as per the latest Kubernetes version and is currently on 1.28
 - Exams require you to solve 15-20 questions in 2 hours.
 - Make use of imperative commands as much as possible.
 - You will have an online notepad on the right corner to note down. I hardly used it, but it can be useful to type and modify text instead of using Vi editor.
 - You are allowed to open another browser tab which can be from kubernetes.io or other products documentation like Falco. Do not open any other windows.
 - Exam questions can be attempted in any order and don't have to be sequential. So be sure to move ahead and come back later.
