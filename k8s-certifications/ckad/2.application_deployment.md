# Application Deployment - 20%

<br />

## Use Kubernetes primitives to implement common deployment strategies (e.g. blue/green or canary)

<br />

- Kubernetes supports only Recreate and Rolling deployments within the same cluster.
- A service mesh like Istio can be used for [traffic management and canary deployments](https://istio.io/latest/docs/tasks/traffic-management/traffic-shifting/).

<br />

## Understand Deployments and how to perform rolling updates

Refer [Deployment Rollouts](../topics/deployments.md#deployment-rollout)

## Use the Helm package manager to deploy existing packages

<br />

 - [Helm](https://helm.sh/) can be used for templating and deployment.
